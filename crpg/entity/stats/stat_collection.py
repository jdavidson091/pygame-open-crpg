# TODO:
#   a collection of stats for some sort of entity.
#   Can be configured per implementation - i.e., dnd 2e would consist of:
#       Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha, Per
#   So a dnd2e entity stat_collection would wrap the character stats
#   Also manages temporary/permanent buffs/debuffs on stats
